### Class tutorials in C++ for FYS3150/FYS4150

This repository contains two tutorials that introduces classes in C++ aimed at students taking the course FYS3150/FYS4150 in computational physics at UiO.

The repo is structured as follows:
  1. [Short introduction to the basics of classes using the trapezoidal rule for integration](https://github.com/reneaas/classes_in_cpp/tree/master/intro_to_classes).
    * If you've never seen how classes are written in C++, you should first take a look at this.
  2. [An advanced tutorial using project 1 in FYS3150 as an example](https://github.com/reneaas/classes_in_cpp/tree/master/advanced_tutorial)
    * Here you will learn how to structure your code using *superclasses and derived classes*.
    * You'll learn how to *automate tasks with python*.
